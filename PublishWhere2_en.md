Here, I will continue describing my experience working with sites and platforms where I publish content.

First of all I was interested in publishing on EU platforms. 
So I tried to search for them and found **Open Research Europe**, **scirp.org** and **eu-opensci.org**.
But they did not look for me to be for usual developer but for scientists to publish the research results.

Then I step up futher and found following more applicable platforms for me:

- **Tech.eu:** Tech.eu provides news, data, and analysis on the European technology industry. It covers topics such as startups, investments, and emerging technologies.
- **The Next Web (TNW):** TNW is a European-based tech media company that covers the latest trends, news, and insights in technology. They accept contributed articles on various IT-related topics.
- **TechCrunch Europe:** TechCrunch is a well-known tech media platform that has a dedicated section for European tech news. They often publish contributed articles from industry experts and thought leaders.
- **Wired UK:** Wired UK covers technology, science, culture, and business with a European perspective. They accept contributed articles and op-eds on IT and related subjects.
- **EU-Startups:** While primarily focused on startups, EU-Startups also covers technology trends and innovations across Europe. They accept guest posts and contributed articles on IT topics relevant to startups and entrepreneurship.
- **Information Age:** Information Age is a UK-based publication that covers technology news, trends, and analysis. They accept contributed articles and opinion pieces on a wide range of IT-related topics.
- **Computer Weekly:** Computer Weekly is a UK-based publication that covers IT news, analysis, and insights. They accept contributed articles and expert opinions on various aspects of information technology.

Finally I selected following platforms to publish and to descrive here:

- dou.eu
- dou.ua

# Analyze
TBD 
As seen in the **comparison** table, most platforms offer only a limited set of functions.
**However**, **Hackernoon**, **Hashnode**, and **Medium** stand out for providing a broader variety of functions.
Personally, I find certain functions to be crucial, including **Tags**, **Human review**, **Syntax checking**, **Article stats**, and **Series.**
It's worth noting that some platforms have issues, which I discovered during use."
