# Introduction

- **Me** - Hey!
- **AI** - How can I assist you today? What type of help do you need?
- **Me** - Can you help me in solution architect advisory?
- **AI** - Of course! I'd be happy to help with your solution architect needs. Could you clarify what type of assistance you're looking for? For example, are you working on: 1. Creating an architecture vision for a project? 2. Evaluating or assessing an existing architecture? 3. Documenting architecture decisions (ADR)? 4. Solution design or specific technical guidance? 5. Any other specific need? Let me know what you need, and I can guide you from there!
