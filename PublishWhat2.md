# Overview
TBD 

---

# Size
The publication should not be overly dense or difficult to read.
When considering a typical piece intended for public consumption, I propose aiming for an ideal publication size of under 2500 words.

On the other hand, the size should not be too small, where it can be consumed in just one minute.
I would suggest 1000 words as the smallest size for a publication.

# No formatting symbols
An important point to note is the absence of any formatting symbols in the publication, such as **</br>** or **&nbsp;&nbsp;**.
These symbols may appear if you copy your content from another document format.

# Citations
There is a recommendation for **citations** to be formatted as in-line links, with any recommended reading listed separately.

# Pictures 
No pictures - less views. pictires shall be related to content

picture orientation suggested to be album and not a book orienttaopn

you would have at least featured image as a title image. it shhould be active like a gif

# Tables 
if you provide tables please make sure that less filled columns are the end of table and wiseversa

When using a quote or definition from another source, it must be cited using an in-line link so we are giving attribution and the reader can verify the information.

However, we would prefer that these papers share a uniquely GL perspective and that the content is 100% original.
