# Overview
TBD 

---

# Size
The publication should not be overly dense or difficult to read.
When considering a typical piece intended for public consumption, I propose aiming for an ideal publication size of under 2500 words.

On the other hand, the size should not be too small, where it can be consumed in just one minute.
I would suggest 1000 words as the smallest size for a publication.

# No formatting symbols
An important point to note is the absence of any formatting symbols in the publication, such as **</br>** or **&nbsp;&nbsp;**.
These symbols may appear if you copy your content from another document format.

# Citations
There is a recommendation for **citations** to be formatted as in-line links, with any recommended reading listed separately.

# Pictures
Please notice a really important point: fewer pictures mean fewer views.
Certainly, all pictures should be related to the text content and enhance its meaning.

I suggest having a featured image as a title image. It might be interactive, like a gif.

I would prefer picture orientation to be album rather than book orientation. It will use the user's screen more efficiently.

# Tables
If you use tables in your publications, please make sure that columns with less content are placed towards the end of the table, and vice versa.

Additionally, I suggest placing more important columns at the beginning of the table so that readers will first encounter the most important information.

# Plagiarism
Please note that readers prefer content to be 100% original.
They expect 0% plagiarism or duplicate content, and all sources must be properly cited.

When using a quote or definition from another source, it must be cited using an in-line link to provide attribution and enable readers to verify the information.

You can use this [website](www.copyscape.com) to check for plagiarism.
