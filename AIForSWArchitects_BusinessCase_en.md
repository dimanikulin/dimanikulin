# 1. Company

*Company Name*: HealthTech Solutions Inc.

*Industry*: Healthcare Technology

*Mission Statement*: Our mission is to revolutionize patient care by providing cutting-edge digital health solutions that enable personalized, data-driven healthcare. Through our advanced Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, we connect patients, doctors, and healthcare providers to optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient well-being.

*Overview:* HealthTech Solutions is a leader in developing IoT-enabled healthcare solutions aimed at providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and early intervention for chronic disease management. With a strong portfolio of AI-driven health products, we aim to transform traditional healthcare systems into data-driven, proactive models.

# 2. Project

*Project Name*: MedConnect IoT Platform

*Project Objective*: The MedConnect IoT platform aims to collect, monitor, and analyze data from patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. By leveraging smart medical devices and wearable technology, the platform will enable continuous patient monitoring, reduce hospital admissions, and support remote diagnosis and treatment plans.

*Problem Statement*:
Chronic disease patients require constant monitoring, which is challenging due to limited healthcare resources and rising patient numbers. Traditional healthcare methods focus on reactive rather than proactive care. Patients often face delayed treatments because of lack of real-time insights, resulting in higher medical costs and poor health outcomes.

*Solution*:
The MedConnect IoT platform provides an integrated solution that captures real-time data from wearable devices, smart monitors, and connected home-based medical devices. The platform uses advanced AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data, offering predictive insights and personalized care recommendations to healthcare providers.

# 3. Decision Makers

*Key Stakeholders*:

- *CEO & Founder*: Oversees strategic decisions and high-level vision for MedConnect.
- *Chief Medical Officer (CMO)*: Ensures the platform aligns with clinical requirements and enhances patient outcomes.
- *Chief Technology Officer (CTO)*: Responsible for technological infrastructure, security, and data analytics.
- *Chief Financial Officer (CFO)*: Manages the financial viability of the project and budget allocation.
- *Product Manager:* Oversees the platform's development, ensuring timely feature releases and customer alignment.
- *Healthcare Providers*: Input from doctors, specialists, and nurses to guide product features based on clinical needs.
TBD
- *Patients*: As end-users, they contribute through feedback and real-world testing.

# 4. Product History

*Initial Concept*: The concept of the MedConnect platform was born out of the growing need for real-time, continuous patient monitoring, especially for chronic disease management. Early prototypes were based on existing wearable devices but quickly evolved to include connected home-based medical devices like glucose monitors, blood pressure cuffs, and smart scales.

*Milestones:*

- *2019*: Initial research and development; prototype launched for internal testing.
- *2020*: Early-stage trials conducted with select hospitals and healthcare institutions.
- *2021*: Public beta released; partnerships established with device manufacturers.
- *2023*: Official product launch; integrated AI analytics platform goes live with healthcare provider integration.

- *Device Interoperability*: Supports integration with multiple medical devices, ensuring flexibility for patients and healthcare providers.

# 7. Actors

*Primary Actors*:

- *Patients*: Chronic disease patients who use the IoT platform for continuous monitoring. Primary beneficiaries of personalized health insights and real-time data tracking.
- *Healthcare Providers*: Doctors, nurses, and specialists who use the platform to monitor and treat patients remotely. They receive alerts on potential health risks and can adjust treatment plans accordingly.
- *Healthcare Institutions (Hospitals/Clinics)*: Institutions benefit by reducing hospital admissions, improving patient outcomes, and lowering healthcare costs.
- *Medical Device Manufacturers*: Providers of smart medical devices that integrate with the platform, enabling data capture from patients.
- *Insurance Companies*: Can leverage the platform’s data to optimize healthcare costs, adjust premiums, and offer wellness programs to policyholders.

# 8. Solution advisory objective

*Goal*:

- To have a well defined big data lake(s) with clear boundaries.
- The data lake(s) should have the capability to ingest the data in batch mode and real time pipeline with appropriate frequency/rate
- The data lake(s) should store the data in the right format which is ideal for the relevant use cases

*In Scope*:

- Identify required Enterprise Data Producing systems
- Data Producer Onboarding
- Data Ingestion (push/pull, batch/streaming/API)
- Archiving and Format Optimization
- Transformation and Enrichment
- Polyglot Storage
- Access Interfaces (API, Export, Analytics Tools, etc.)
- Identify Enterprise Data Consumer systems
- Data Consumer Onboarding
- Administration and Operational Tools
- Data Warehouse Capability
- Enterprise Data Governance
- Enabling Data Science and other internal teams to effectively access/consume the data
- Enabling various BI reports to effectively access/consume the data

*Out-Of-Scope*:

- Core Artificial Intelligence /Machine Learning/Data Science Capabilities
- Core Reporting Capabilities
- Surrounding Transactional Systems/Feature System/Teams’ Capabilities and Roadmaps
- Market Study/Business Value Analysis
- Data Producing/Consuming systems not identified as key/required systems

This also includes consolidation of data per cloud and per environment. There is a need to explore solutions and architecture of the future state platform(s) in which the need to copy data from one platform to another, one environment to another, is effectively managed, minimized and potentially eliminated.
