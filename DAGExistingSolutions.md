# Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
| # | Abbreviation or Acronym | Definition     |
| - | ------------------------|:--------------:|
| 1 | API | is a computing interface to a software component or a system, that defines how other components or systems can use it. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc|
| 2 | AUTOSAR | AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture is a development partnership of automotive interested parties founded in 2003. It pursues the objective to create and establish an open and standardized software architecture for automotive electronic control units|
| 3 | Bamboo | Bamboo is a continuous integration and deployment tool that ties automated builds, tests and releases together in a single workflow.|

| 7 | CI/CD | CI/CD or CICD is the combined practices of continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.|
| 8 | Containers | A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing.|
| 9 | Compliance | In general, compliance means conforming to a rule, such as a specification, policy, standard or law. Compliance has traditionally been explained by reference to the deterrence theory, according to which punishing a behavior will decrease the violations both by the wrongdoer and by others.|
| 10| DevOps | DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.|

It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat.|
| 12| Microservices | A microservice architecture – a variant of the SOA structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The goal is that teams can bring their services to life independent of others|
| 13| MISRA C | MISRA C is a set of software development guidelines for the C programming language developed by The MISRA Consortium. Its aims are to facilitate code safety, security, portability and reliability in the context of embedded systems, specifically those systems programmed in ISO C / C90 / C99.|
| 14| OLAP | Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that organizes large business databases and supports complex analysis. It can be used to perform complex analytical queries without negatively affecting transactional systems.|

| 16| SCA | Static Code Analysis - One of the capabilities of the CI/CD pipeline. Its purpose is to check the code using a predefined set of rules. SCA usually is performed between Build and Test stages.|
| 17| SOA | In software engineering, service-oriented architecture is an architectural style that focuses on discrete services instead of a monolithic design|
| 18| UML | The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.|

## Bionic.ai
[Bionic](https://www.bionic.ai/) is a platform designed to analyze the **architecture** of applications and their dependencies in real-time.
Initially, it creates a **baseline** of the architecture during the initial scan.
Subsequently, whenever a **change occurs**, the **next scan** is triggered to detect any drift or erosion.
The platform supports regular scans by seamlessly integrating **Bionic.ai** into the **CI/CD** pipeline.
Upon detecting a change, Bionic.ai suggests the context and thoroughly analyzes the potential impact of the changes.
As a result, it generates comprehensive software **architecture** diagrams, encompassing deployment, logical, and flow views.

### Main features
- Facilitates checking if architecture rules and standards are applied
- Aids in identifying any structural or behavioral changes
- Conducts code and document scans during the initial or scheduled stages
- Determines new APIs in the application
- Capable of finding new data flows
- Detects new connections
- Provides a prioritized list of risks once changes occur

## Castsoftware Highlight
[Cast Highlight](https://www.castsoftware.com/products/highlight) is an application designed to automatically analyze the source code.

### Main features:
- Analyzes the code to identify processes/applications suitable for refactoring, retirement, or rebuilding.
- Provides a readiness percentage for migrating to the cloud based on the analysis.

## Castsoftware Cast Imaging 
[Cast Imaging](https://www.castsoftware.com/imaging) is an application that creates visualizations of **architecture**, offering several levels of detailed views ranging from services level up to code/classes level.
It defines data flows from the high-level application perspective down to the database level.
When changes occur, it provides the impact analysis, such as a list of components affected by the breaking of component communication.
Additionally, it creates inventories of **databases**, **libraries/frameworks**, and **languages**.

### Main features
- Performs reverse engineering of code, databases, and application dependencies.
- Generates holistic architecture views and blueprints.
- Interactive mode for exploring architecture views.
- Tagging feature to group components based on criteria, enabling easy component search and filtering after tagging is completed.

## NDepend
[NDepend](https://www.workshell.co.uk/products/netdepends/) is an application designed to analyze **C#** code, checking it against best practices and rules created by developers and architects. 
The tool enables users to manage dependencies through the creation of graphs and matrices.

### Main features

- Utilize built-in rules and customize them according to specific needs.
- Investigate application structure and library linkages.
- Seamless integration into the CI/CD process, enabling real-time identification of code and architecture issues.
- Provides insights into the cost and priority of fixing identified issues.
