Here, I will describe my experience working with sites and platforms where I publish content.
The main question here is, *Why do you publish content?*.
This will help you choose the right platform to publish on.

At first, I selected several *easy-to-use* platforms:

- hackernoon
- Hashnode
- Dev.to
- Medium
- Reddit
- Quora
- LinkedIn

You might wonder how to manage multiple platforms, especially when you have a lot of materials to publish.
The truth is, it's not a big deal.
I've created a separate table with columns for each **platform** and rows for individual **publications**.

# hackernoon
[hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) publishes technology stories and builds publishing software.
It has a content editor similar to WordPad.

For each story, it provides the following options:

- **Feature picture** - Title picture
- **Tags** - a set of keywords to speed up the search
- **Make Your Story Stand Out** - up to a 160-symbol description
- **Emoji** - Credibility Indicator Guide
- **Give a Shout Out to People on Twitter** - Send a link to Twitter
- **Townhall Mode**: - Anyone Can Comment: On or Off
- **TL;DR** - Post Description
- **First Seen At** - a link to the original story, only for republished stories

It provides a full review cycle, including human review, which takes up to one week. I have tried to publish three times without success, and the reasons for rejection were: too small, not current, non-working links, and spelling errors.

For another story, it stated, *Promoting links in stories, @username? You would need to enter our brand as an author program instead.*
This meant too many links to one domain inside a story.

Please note that it might generate the wrong **TL;DR.**
In my case, it generated a **TL;DR** based on part of the text, not the whole publication.

Additionally, it is impossible to discuss the problems that the editor found right on the platform.
I received emails and could reply back.

# hashnode
[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) is a one-stop platform to start blogging as a developer.
*Begin a blog, share knowledge, attain creator independence, and grow your career.*

It has a content editor like WordPad.

What I really liked about **Hashnode** is its nice feature - checking for syntax in **Grammarly.**

While editing, it shows article stats:

**Word count:** 869 words
**Paragraphs:** 27 paragraphs
**Read time:** 4 minutes

For each story, it provides the possibility to:

- Add a **Cover** - Main picture
- Add a **Subtitle** - Description
- Select a **BLOG** and **ARTICLE SLUG**
- Add up to 5 tags
- Generate a **TABLE OF CONTENTS**
- Add a **CUSTOM OG IMAGE** - Upload an image to display when your article is embedded online or on social network feeds
- Fill up **SEO TITLE** - The "SEO Title" will be shown in place of your Title on search engine results pages, such as a Google search. SEO titles between 40 and 50 characters with commonly searched words have the best click-through rates.
- Fill up **SEO DESCRIPTION** - The SEO Description will be used in place of your Subtitle on search engine results pages. Good SEO descriptions utilize keywords, summarize the article, and are between 140-156 characters long.
- Indicate if **YOU ARE REPUBLISHING?** Change the canonical URL of this article to the original article.
- Schedule publication - Select a publishing date/time (Based on your local time zone)
- Select **PUBLISH ON A BACKDATE**
- Disable comments - This will hide the comments section below your article.
- Hide the article from **HASHNODE FEED** - If you'd rather not have your article show up in Hashnode's feed that's displayed to our entire community.

# Medium 
[Medium](https://medium.com/) is an open platform where readers discover dynamic thinking, and where expert and undiscovered voices can share their writing on any topic.

It has a content editor similar to Wordpad.

For each story, it provides the following possibilities:

- Make this story **unlisted?** Your public story will be available to anyone and will not be eligible for payment. Your followers will be notified when you publish for the first time.
- Change **featured image:** Title image
- Change **title and subtitle:** The title and subtitle are used on your publication homepage, in previews of your story on Medium, and on social media.
- Change **topics (aka tags)**
- Pin **story:** Pinning a story keeps it at the top of the page until you specify otherwise. Pin this story to the top of your profile.
- Set **SEO Title:** The SEO Title is used in place of your Title on search engine results pages, such as a Google search. SEO titles over 60 characters will be truncated. SEO titles between 40 and 50 characters with commonly searched words have the best click-through rates.
- Set **SEO Description:** The SEO Description is used in place of your Subtitle on search engine results pages. Good SEO descriptions utilize keywords, summarize the story, and are between 140-156 characters long.
- Add **Friend Link:** This link guarantees anyone free access to your story, even if they’ve read all of their complimentary stories for this month. Learn more.
- Set **Content Licensing**
- Customize **Story Link**
- Customize **Canonical Link:** To set URL to show if this story was originally published elsewhere.

You can schedule posting a story later.
Please note that it removed bolding in the text I copied from GitHub.

# Quora
[Quora](https://www.quora.com/) is a place to gain and share knowledge.
It's a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers.
Quora features a content editor similar to Wordpad.

## Analyze
As seen in the **comparison** table, most platforms offer only a limited set of functions.
**However**, **Hackernoon**, **Hashnode**, and **Medium** stand out for providing a broader variety of functions.
Personally, I find certain functions to be crucial, including **Tags**, **Human review**, **Syntax checking**, **Article stats**, and **Series.**
It's worth noting that some platforms have issues, which I discovered during use."
