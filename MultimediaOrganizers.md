## Multimedia Organizers functions
A program that helps organizing photos is known as a **photo organizer**.
There are a variety of **photo organizer** software programs available on the market, and each one provides various features and tools to assist in organizing photos.
Thus, let’s consider main functions multimedia organizers perform:

* they provide the possibility to search through a photo set by organizing photos based on their date, location, categories, etc.;
* they offer an option of creating a folder structure and place the files in it;
* they automate the import of new photos into **IR Multimedia Systems**.

Additionally, they make photo albums more searchable (that is driven by **IR Multimedia Systems**) by enriching the **metadata** (and improving its consistency) with minimal human involvement.

Therefore, they are chosen as a subject for the overview and comparison.
A list of **Photo Organizers** for professional photographers is created, and those [organizers](https://www.pixpa.com/blog/photo-organiser) can also be used by an ordinary user with a big photo album.
Pertinent online [courses](https://www.organizepictures.com/organize-digital-photos-course) are available to instruct users on how to arrange the photos.
More detailed comparison of photo organizers is provided by Wikipedia and is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_organizer).

## Multimedia Organizer requirements

* a user will be working with a large number of items, so automated approach is recommended;
* a toolset that is available for a typical user and not for enterprises shall be used;
* they shall provide integration with such **Multimedia IR Systems** as **digiKam** and **Synology Moments**;
* they shall be able to identify inconsistent or nonexistent photo metadata;
* they shall be able to suggest ways to solve inconsistency and absence.

## Multimedia Organizer approaches to create folder structure
The goal is to prevent duplicate photos from being stored in the same folder.
In order to construct subfolders based on the number of photographers or cameras, the folder name may be something like Date Shoot-Type Event Name; 
it could also contain a location or any other information the user desires.
