What I learned as a Product Manager while creating my product

Creating a High-Level Product Documentation and Requirements: A Journey from Design Thinking to User Scenarios.

# Article description
It have described author's journey of creating a product line, which started with the idea of developing a single product, the FVA Tool Set, and ended up with the creation of a set of high-level product documentation, a detailed understanding of the product from the user's perspective, and product requirements. 
Author mentioned that he started from coding but realized later that it would have been better to start from Design Thinking, a process that consists of seven stages for creating a product. 
Author also mentioned that he established a set of documentation artifacts to keep high-level product knowledge, such as Value Propositions, Business Model Canvas, Product Vision Board, and Competitive Analysis Matrix. 
Additionally, author focused on the product from the user's perspective and created a Persona, a User Journey, and User Scenarios to show the value of the product. 
Finally, author identified stakeholders and created a table with their roles, concerns, and views, and created a questionnaire to clarify user needs.

## Design Thinking
The first product I was thinking about was "FVA Tool Set".
Subsequently, another product came to my mind. As a result, a Product Line came about.

- "Hold on, you started from thinking of products, right?", - you will ask me.
- "Nope, I started from... It was ages ago and a whole [history](../README.md#history) is quite big. Being a developer, I started from coding".
- "Was it a good idea to start from coding?", - you will ask me. 
- "Again no. I would have started from Design Thinking, if I was familiar with it." 

Design Thinking is a process of preparation, which consists of seven stages of creating a product:

- **Empathize-who, goal, do** Here you need to create an artifact called "Empathy Map" with a formula - who, goal, do;
- **Empathize-see, say, do, hear** Here you need to create an artifact called "Empathy Map" with a formula - see, say, do, hear;
- **Empathize-think and feel** Here you need to create an artifact called "Empathy Map" with a formula - think and feel;
- **Define: Problem Statement** Here you need to describe a problem basing on the "Empathy Map";
- **Ideate** Here you need to nave a list of raw ideas to explore.
- There are also other stages not mentioned here.

## High-level product documentation
Once I came up with product ideas to implement, I realized that a set of documentation artifacts to keep high-level product knowledge had to be established.

### Value Propositions
The first artifact to consider was Value Proposition.
which has the following components:
- **Mapper** for Products and Services to Customer Jobs;
- **Mapper** for Gain creators to Gains;
- **Mapper** for Pain relievers to Pains;
- **One Pager** with Value Proposition.

### Business Model Canvas
The next artifact was Business Model Canvas. 
I downloaded a template [here](strategyzer.com) and filled in the following fields:
- **Key Partners** to answer the questions: **Who are the key partners? Who are the key suppliers?**
- **Key Activities** to answer the questions: **What are the main tasks that the company must do well to deliver its value?**
- **Key Resources** to answer the questions: **What are the most important physical, financial, intellectual or human recourses the company has?**
- **Value Propositions** to answer the questions: **What value do we deliver to the customer? Which customer needs do we want to satisfy?**
- **Customer Relationships** to answer the questions: **What type of relationship does each of the customer segments expect us to establish and maintain with them?**
- **Channels** to answer the questions: **Which channels do our customer segments want to be reached through? How do we reach them now?**
- **Customer Segments** to answer the questions: **Whom are we creating value for? Who are our most important customers?**
- **Revenue Streams** to answer the questions: **What value are our customers willing to pay for? What do they currently pay for? How do they pay? How would they prefer to pay?**
- **Cost Structure** to answer the questions: **Where do the costs come from?**

### Product Vision Board
The third artifact was Product Vision Board.
I downloaded a template [here](https://www.romanpichler.com/) and filled in the following fields:
- **VISION** to answer the questions: **What is your purpose for creating the product? Which positive change should it bring about?**
- **TARGET GROUP** to answer the questions: **Which market or market segment does the product address? Who are target customers and users?**
- **NEEDS** to answer the questions: **What problem does the product solve? Which benefit does it provide?**
- **PRODUCT** to answer the questions: **What kind of product is it? What makes it stand out? Is it feasible to develop the product?**
- **BUSINESS GOALS** to answer the questions: **How is the product going to benefit the company? What are business goals?**

### Competitive Analysis Matrix
The last artifact in High-level product documentation was Competitive Analysis Matrix
I filled in the following rows for several products:
- **Vision** with **Goal and Target segment**;
- **Marketing** with **Pricing and  Unique value proposition**;
- **End user support** with **Trainings, User guide and Help desk**;
- **Features**.

## Product from user prospective
As soon as high-level product documentation was ready, I decided to go deeper with more detail from the user's point of view.

### Persona 
The first artifact I created was Persona
I downloaded a template [here](https://www.romanpichler.com/) and filled in the following fields:
- **PICTURE & NAME** to answer the questions: **What does the persona look like? What is his/her name?** I chose a realistic and plausible picture and name.
- **DETAILS** to answer the questions: **What are personaâ€™s relevant characteristics and behaviors?** I wrote in demographics, such as age, gender, occupation, and income; psychographics, including lifestyle, social class, and personality; and behavioral attributes like usage patterns, attitudes and brand loyalty.
- **GOAL** to answer the questions: **What problem does persona want to solve or which benefit does the character seek? Why would persona want to use or buy the product?**

### User Journey and User Scenarios
Then I tried to restore user way to achieve the goals. 
And I came up with User Journey.

To show the value of the product, I created three user scenarios and posted them on YouTube. Please see the reference to watch them.

### Stakeholders
Honestly, a bit later I realized that end users are not the only target audience for this product.
And next artifact - Stakeholders - came into sight.
It looks like a table with the following columns: Group, Stakeholder Role, Concerns, View.
Table rows contain as follows: End users, Suppliers and Team members.

## Product requirements 
Having defined everything from the user's point of view, I started thinking what exactly the product will implement.

### Questionnaire
Having no clue what is important for the user and what is not, I created a [questionnaire to clarify user needs](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EI3oOumRnHxDjEYgV6PFB-AMfV5plLtuV2r5S8BYn_g/).
It is a form to gather information on what capabilities, functions and scenarios are important.

### Capabilities
Having gained an understanding of user needs, I started describing [Capabilities](./REQUIREMENTS.md#capabilities)
Literally, Capabilities describe key requirements.

### Features
Having capability list defined, I started preparing features.
They represent significant, central functionality of the final system. 
I put them into the table with the following columns: Name, Clarification, Business Value.
The feature set helped me to create a project plan and a road map. 

### Functional Requirements
Last but not least step in defining product behavior was a list of **Functional Requirements**, that define system detail behavior.
I settled them into the table with the following columns: **Name**, **Architecture complexity**, **Business Value**, **Component**, **Phase**, **Feature ID**.

## Product development documents

### Product Road Map
I believe, **Product Road Map** is the most important document for a product at the development stage. 
I downloaded a template [here](https://www.romanpichler.com/) and filled in the following fields and rows:
- **DATE** with **Release date or timeframe**;
- **NAME** with **Name of new release**;
- **GOAL** with **The benefit a product should provide**;
- **FEATURES** with **High-level features necessary to meet the goal**;
- **METRICS** with **Metrics to determine if the goal has been met**.
Columns there are the product different version.

On the top of that, it is quite convenient to keep an [online roadmap](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/projects/4).
