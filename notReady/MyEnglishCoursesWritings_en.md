# Describing house

2006.11.01
Hi Luba!

I�d like to describe house I would like to have. It is imaginary in general nevertheless it is enough real to think of.
It is exactly the most detached house you have ever seen because there is nothing near it as far as you can see.   It�s perfectly situated in the center of big green field. Only path (made from nature stone) connects house with whole world.
The house has two floors. First floor consists of 3 usual rooms: big living room, kitchen and bathroom with swimming-pool.  The wide stairway is a way to second floor that is not as usual as previous one. The second floor is a big room with walls that are big windows. In the second floor there is room in the center of area and it is bedroom.  The main thing about house is smart-house functions - nothing should be done to open or close door or window, or switch lights.  
The neighborhood is safe and friendly because there is none. And it is a reason also why it is a beautiful area. It is big yard near house and you can listen to real silence if there is no wind.
A main purpose of this house is for small family with 4 people maximal. No mother-in-low, no father-in-low, no grandparents are allowed.  But any pets are welcome.

With best regards,
Dima.

# My home town

2007.09.21
I was born in Donetsk, an industrial city in the south - east of the Ukraine. Donetsk is a big town, because its population is about 1 million people and there are a lot of buildings, universities, institutes, shops and etc.
For example it has 2 theatres, about 10 cinemas, a few parks. But first of all this town is industrial city. It has a lot coal-mining, chemical and meal plans that gives a work for thousands people.
50 years ago this town was called �town of coalmen� because there lived a lot of people who were connected to coal-mining industrial. Also in that time town had a lot of roses and since it had name - �town of roses�. It was speaking that there where a million of roses.
I can not say I like this town very much. Why don't I like it very much? Because living in this city you don�t do the good things for you health, but you can earn a big money there to buy a bit health for yourself. Also I dislike it because Donetsk does not have the name �town of roses�. Why do I like it? I like it because I was born there. I like it because there are a lot of new buildings.

# Story of our love

2006.12.01

It tale is based on really actions.
No fiction actions and no fiction names.

Story of our love.

First our meeting was on the �green� party. That party was based by our friends. It was at Easter Day and it was in Yasinovatskiy Park. But that meeting did not produce an impression for us.
Second our meeting was four month later. It was on the birthday one of our friends. Phone call was after that. Unfortunately I don�t remember date of this event. I make phone call to my future wife and we solved to make private meeting, without many people, without many alcohol and etc. Only after that meeting we began meet.  We celebrate this day as day of meeting. Numerous appointments were then. I made proposition to my girl after six month and we will remember our wedding day all our life. It was beautiful. That is all.

# About Donetsk

2007.01.23

## Donetsk's History

I'd like to tell about Donetsk-sity.  Population of Donetsk-sity is about 1 million. It was founded by Jon Use at the end of 19-th century.
At the middle of the 20 th century Donetsk had second name - Town of the Roses.  By some information, Donetsk had more than 1 million rose�s bush.
Third name was Town of miner.

## Donetsk now

But now its second name is Achmetov-city.  So, Donetsk-sity is a capital of Achmetov Region. Town hasn't got much flowers and many miner. But it has got
many shops, supermarkets, superminimarket, extrasuperminimarket.
Donetsk is famous for many things. First of all it is Rinat Axmetov, his football club Shachter and many others sings

## Donetsk's problem

Unfortunately, Donetsk environment is very dirty. I think Donetsk-sity is dirtiest town in Ukraine.
My town has got many plant and factory which did and do our town dirtier.
I like this town and I want that Donetsk will be cleaner than it is now.

After I had no problem tooths and also had no money.

# Terrible story

2007.07.27
Hi Luba
I would like to tell a story about the worst tour I have ever had.
It was several years ago when I and my wife went to Crimea for honeymoon. We traveled by train and bus and we stayed in the small hotel named �Babushka Galya� in Koktebel town. We wanted to see whole Crimea but we especially wanted to see cave city near town called �Bahchisaray�. So we booked one-day local tour.
In the early sunny morning we, with tourist group, left Koktebel and began our adventure. So far so good we went to Bahchisaray in three hours. Our bus left us near the foot of the mountain as it could not drive in the mountains. The mountains were not high however they were with steep slope and rocky. The first bad thing we faced was one hour of waiting for next group to climb up. It was summer and it was really hot summer. There were not any trees to sit in the shadow. But it still was not the worst thing we have met.
After �sun-bathing� we had to move and next �not good� thing was that it was going to rain. Our guide said that usually it does not rain long time. We started climbing up, and we noticed that clouds get darker and darker. It had started raining before we managed to pass whole way to cave city. Of course nobody took an umbrella. When we reached cave city our wear was whole wet. The weather became worse however we walked around the city. We could not find any place to shelter from rain. After �watching� the cave city we had to go back to bus and we found out new thing about walking down with rain. It was really hard to walk down the mountain because slopes were slick extremely. Also small stones were rolling down while we came back to the bus. They tried to hit people and some ones were near to hurt their body parts. We even forgot about rain and about wet wear. It seemed our walking will never be finished. We spent two times more time to go down than to go up.
When we got our bus it was mostly dark and rain became rainfall. Bus driver and our guide decided to use other way to come back to Koktebel as previous way was dangerous because of weather conditions. New way was further than previous one in about 100 kilometers and we had to spend about 5 hours to get back. The rain was not going to leave us. We felt that it wanted to drop the bus from motorway. We were really scared of weather because thunder and lightning were power. Bus even stopped a few times as rain wall did not allow driver to keep driving. Although it was a deep night and it was about 2 AM no one was sleeping when we came back to Koktebel.
We do remember that trip, but it is as about nightmare and not as about reality.

       With the best wishes, Dmitry

First of all I will tell you a bit about myself and maybe you will know something new about me.

I live in small Ukrainian town - Maxbillonesk. It is near New York or near Paris I think.T here is not any parks, any trees but there are a lot of computers. I live with my second father, mother and about 40 idea brothers. We all work in our town that is our office.

We have only one hobby - it is money. We can see to the money all hours of day. From time to time we play to beer and vodka but it is not our main hobbi, please do not think so.

At this moment we are spending time when our office is under hard reconstruction. Sometimes we do not have light, water and etc... If you can save us, please do it!
