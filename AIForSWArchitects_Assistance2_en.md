# Introduction

- **Me** - Hey!
- **AI** - How can I assist you today? What type of help do you need?
- **Me** - Can you help me in solution architect advisory?
- **AI** - Of course! I'd be happy to help with your solution architect needs. Could you clarify what type of assistance you're looking for? For example, are you working on: 1. Creating an architecture vision for a project? 2. Evaluating or assessing an existing architecture? 3. Documenting architecture decisions (ADR)? 4. Solution design or specific technical guidance? 5. Any other specific need? Let me know what you need, and I can guide you from there!
- **Me** - Solution design

- **AI** -
Great! To assist you effectively with the solution design, let's break the process into key steps:

**Step 1: Define Architecture Drivers**
We need to define the requirements and constraints that will shape the solution design. These include:

- *Business case and business goals*
- *Constraints (business, technical, legal, etc.)*
- *Main use cases*
- *Main features*
- *Domain model*
- *Quality attribute scenarios (like performance, scalability, security)*

**Step 2: Solution Architecture Design**
After gathering the architecture drivers, we will move on to design the architecture, which includes:

- *Context View*: The big picture, defining the overall system and external interactions.
- *System Decomposition View*: Breaking down the system into modules or components.
- *Deployment View:* Physical deployment details (on-premise or cloud infrastructure).
- *CI/CD View:* Continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline.
- *Technology Stack*: Selection of languages, frameworks, and tools based on architecture drivers.

**Step 3: Operational Plan**
We'll then define how the system will operate in production, including monitoring, scaling, and updates.

**Step 4: Solutions Roadmap and Team Composition**
We'll define a timeline for delivering the solution and the skillset needed for the development and operations team.

To start, I need to ask: Do you have any specific business goals or constraints already identified? If not, I can guide you through that process as well.

- **Me** - I have business goals and contains as well

- **AI** - Excellent! Let's move forward with defining the business goals and constraints.

Step 1: Define Business Goals
Please provide me with the business goals you have, or if you'd like, I can help format them for you. We’ll list them along with their priority (Hard or Soft).

The format will be: | # | Description | Priority (Hard/Soft) |

Once you provide the business goals, we’ll proceed to constraints.

Would you like to list them out, or should I guide you further on structuring them?

- **Me** - I will list them

- **AI** - Perfect! Go ahead and list the business goals, and I will structure them for you.

- **Me** - Provided Business Goals/Drivers from [business case 2](./AIForSWArchitects_BusinessCase2_en.md)

- **AI** - With the business goals defined, we can now proceed to the constraints. Please list them as well, and I will organize those next.

- **Me** - Provided Constrains from [business case 2](./AIForSWArchitects_BusinessCase2_en.md)

- **AI** - Now that we have the business goals and constraints outlined, we can proceed to define the main use cases.
Would you prefer the use cases in *Markdown* format or *Plant UML* for better visualization?

- **Me** - Markdown

- **AI** - Great! Let's move on to defining the main use cases. Could you provide details on the use cases you want to include, such as:
- The use case name.
- A description of what the use case does.
- The actors (who or what interacts with the system).

- **Me** - Provided Use Cases from [business case 2](./AIForSWArchitects_BusinessCase2_en.md)

- **AI** - With the main use cases defined, we can now proceed to list the main features of the solution. Would you like to list them, or should I guide you on structuring the features?

- **Me** - Provided main features from [business case 2](./AIForSWArchitects_BusinessCase2_en.md)
