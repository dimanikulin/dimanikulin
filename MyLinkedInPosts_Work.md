Спершу історія. У мене була ранка незагойна неглибока, яка почалася з маленької подряпини. На жаль, вона поступово розширювалася, мабуть тому, що потрапила ззовні якась активна речовина. При чому інші ранки гоїлися, а ця ні. Довелося звернутися до страхової за медичною страховкою. Я припускав, що страхові повинні рекомендувати прості рішення, щоб заощадити гроші страховий і мені час. І коли дзвонив у страхову, думав, що зараз направлять до дерматолога. Та ні. Іди до терапевта або до хірурга, на вибір - сказала страхова. Справа в тому, що у медиків і у страховиків є протоколи - алгоритми постановки діагнозу та методи лікування. Терапевт поставила досить серйозний діагноз – виразка. Ну що б переконається, рекомендувала піти до хірурга. Ну що б не закопали швидше, ніж потрібно) Хірург сказав, що не все так погано – локальне зараження шкіри. Але щоб переконатися в діагнозі, потрібно йти, еврика, до дерматолога. Дерматолог підтверджує діагноз та дає простенький, але ефективний крем. Крем за два-три дні все лікує і через 2 тижні мені вже потрібно постаратися, щоб знайти де була ранка. Принагідно дерматолог рекомендує ще здати 100 500 аналізів і піти до ендокринолога. Підсумок для страхової: Мені оплачені 4 лікарі та купа аналізів. Міг бути один лікар і менше аналізів. Підсумок для мене: Зрозумів, що протокольність – не тільки добре, але ще й погано) Ну тобто, нежить лікаря плюс мінус можуть лікувати без зайвих відвідувань медичних установ, але якщо трохи складніше - готуйся до квестів: - А давай спробуємо ось це, і ще ось це, і трохи ось це. - Ну якщо не працює, то тоді це, це і це. - Нічого не спрацювало? Ну тоді йди до іншого лікаря. Я розумію, що при всій технічності та розвиненості медицини, досі існує багато хвороб, які і лікувати важко і діагностувати причину теж. Наприклад, у 2020 році я здавав аналіз, формулу якого знайшли лише у 2017. Тобто аналізу було лише 3 роки. З одного боку ми там робимо заміну серця та нирок, лазимо по судинах, підключаємося до мозку та нервів. І на тобі шукали так довго хімічну формулу. Можливо, в деяких інших країнах інакше. А Ви маєте аналогічний досвід? | |

The interviewee greeted me in Ukrainian, which was a pleasant surprise. When I asked how he learned Ukrainian, he explained that he has friends in Ukraine and has visited them. I suggested we switch to Ukrainian, but he declined as he doesn't speak it very well. During the interview, I noticed that he had two or even three monitors, one of which he used to communicate with me through a camera. At first, he struggled with practical tasks, but when I checked his theoretical knowledge, he showed a good level. I asked him a lot of questions, and he answered them in the same manner - he would think and then move his eyes to the keyboard or other monitor before providing an answer. After a while, he would either say that he wasn't sure about the answer or give me the wrong answer entirely. But then he would provide the correct answer. Because time was limited, I had to rush him in his thinking for each answer, which made him nervous. I noticed that when he moved his eyes, he seemed to be reading something on his second display. It was clear that he was trying to cheat. So, some red flags to watch out for during an interview include: - Avoiding eye contact; - Acting nervous or defensive; - Appearing to read notes; - Being overly friendly in an attempt to disarm you and lower your vigilance.PS. Based on real interview.| |
| | Interviews | AI tools for interview | interviewer ai interviewtips cheating | <img src="./Images/InterviewAITools.png" alt="Interview AI Tools" /> | [01/08/2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dimanikulin_ai-interviewtips-cheating-activity-7092037033061232640-bL5J?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) {1086/4/0/0} | Nowadays, people actively use AI to learn, grow, and engage in many other positive endeavors. However, some individuals may employ AI to cheat, gaining an advantage during interviews. One such new AI tool is called Ecout, which can listen to an interviewer's questions in real-time and generate instant answers. This poses a potential problem for interviewers. To detect such cases, I suggest the following: - Maintain eye contact. If a person frequently avoids eye contact, it may indicate the use of cheating tools.; - Avoid waiting too long for an answer, as this could allow candidates to receive hints from AI tools incrementally.; And here are some other tips for interviewers: - Be maximally objective to ensure fairness throughout the interview process. - Maintain a poker face, as revealing emotions might help a candidate guess the correct answer. What measures do you take to avoid the use of AI tools during interviews?

А переклад — ще тонша. І ця історія - доказ. Був я якось у США, у відрядженні. Та сидим ми якось у переговорці.

Все культурно, по-діловому, англійською мовою, як і водиться на міжнародних проектах. Американець ставить питання людині з Індії (тій, що на зв’язку). І та відповідає. І не просто відповідає — видає повноцінну лекцію хвилин на п’ять. Інтонації, приклади, філософські вставки… Дивлюся на американця — обличчя в нього, як у "Windows" ноутбука, що завис на оновленнях: усміхається, але душа вже кричить. Він киває, типу “все ясно”, а потім повертається до місцевої людини з Індії та й запитує: — Ем… а що він сказав? І тут — без єдиної емоції — наш місцевий індійський колега спокійно видає: — Думаю… він сказав “так”. І от я сиджу, намагаюся не зареготати. Бо так. Просто “так”. А ви коли-небудь були на зустрічі, не маючи жодного розуміння, про що йде мова? Ну і ще, є у вас на роботі “перекладач з англійської на англійську”?    |   |

До сьогоднішних часів потрапити в АйТі було легше, ніж будь-коли до цьго. Курси, марафони, багаточисельні гайди - двері були відкриті для всіх. Але є один нюанс, про який не прийнято казати вголос: чим "нижчий" поріг входу до АйТі, тим "легше" з нього й вийти. Якщо ти прийшов просто тому, що "перспективно", "модно" чи "тут платять" - я вважаю, ти на тимчасовому квитку. Стає складно, та конкуренція зростає - так само легко, як увійшов, можеш і вийти.Ти по-справжньому в ІТ тоді коли не шукаєш мотивацію - тобі справді цікаво. І це я ще про ШІ нічого не сказав. Відео для заспокоєння.  |     |

Пам’ятаєте, як раніше на кожній зустрічі обов’язково був «той самий хтось», хто сидів, усе записував і потім розсилав Minutes of Meeting? Тепер я зрозумів, що цього «когось» можуть звати… Gemini🙂Так, саме Gemini! Бо він зробив усе за як підручником на крайньому мітінгу: - Нотацію мітингу, - Важливі деталі, - Майбутні кроки, - Самарі. І це без кавових пауз, відпусток та «ой, я не встиг(ла) розіслати MoM». Ідеально! Але не з’являється у нас новий корпоративний етикет: «якщо тебе замінив ШІ, значить ти був секретарем»(якщо що, то нічого не маю против секретарів😉)? А ви вже пробували довіряти ШІ ведення MoM?  |          |

Хочу поділитися досвідом: нещодавно я вперше взяв участь у шаховому турнірі, організованому компанією. Про турнір дізнався приблизно за два місяці - формально часу на підготовку було достатньо, але..... робочий режим вніс свої корективи. Тобто до турніру зіграв буквально кілька партій, просто щоб згадати, які фігури взагалі є на дошці 😄 Переважно розраховував на вже набуті раніше навички. І вже десь на третій партії (формат по 10 хвилин) стало зрозуміло: це ще те випробування. З одного боку - майже 3 години практично безперервної гри (9 партій), постійна напруга й жодної можливості перепочити. З іншого -максимальна концентрація, різні стилі гри та дуже різноманітні суперники. Досвід вийшов цікавий і точно запам’ятається. А у вас було щось схоже? Коли входили в змагання або новий виклик майже без підготовки?    |  |
