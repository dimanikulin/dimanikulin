|  | Закон підлості | Закон підлості   | Закон підлості в дії, ваучери, математика  | <img src="./Images/vauchers.jpg" alt="Закон підлості" /> | [17/04/2025](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dimanikulin_%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%8C-%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BC-%D1%89%D0%B5-%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD-%D0%BF%D1%96%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%96-%D0%B2-%D0%B4%D1%96%D1%97-activity-7318525260947988481-4DA6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAlsWb8BPAbKMyDiy56H2KfpjQJ1GthAUxM) {TBD/TBD/TBD/TBD} |  Ось вам ще історія про закон підлості в дії: ваучери, математика та моя самовпевненість. Нещодавно мені дісталися три електронні ваучери на купівлю техніки — на 5000, 1000 і 500 гривень. Радість була величезна, адже халява — це святе! Кожен ваучер мав свій термін дії, тому я, як людина «відповідальна», вирішив перевірити строки. Подивився на ті, що на 1000 і 500 — усе ок, час ще є. 😉 А найбільший, на 5000… ну, подумав: та що йому буде, якщо два нормальні? Чисто математично, вірогідність того, що саме один буде протермінований, а два нормальні — десь 3,5%. Це ж мізер! Спокійний, як танк, відкладаю великого хлопця на потім. І от настав день покупок. Приходжу з цим чарівним ваучером до магазину, дістаю… і тут — сюрприз. Він протермінований. На місяць. 😵‍💫 І я чую тихий шепіт із всесвіту: «Вітаємо, ви виграли в лотереї Закону Підлості!» Мораль? Перевіряй усе. Особливо те, в чому найбільше впевнений. Бо цей закон працює завжди, навіть коли математика — на твоєму боці. А у вас траплялися такі ситуації?    |  |

Sensitive Information!) in their messages as a tactic to deceive or manipulate others, and they may not be concerned about the consequences of doing so. If you receive a message that you suspect may be fraudulent or deceptive, it is important to exercise caution and to verify the authenticity of the message before taking any action. This may involve double-checking the source of the message, looking for signs of phishing or other scams, or seeking guidance from a trusted authority or expert. By taking these precautions, you can help protect yourself from potential harm and avoid falling victim to scams or other types of fraud. Stay safe! | |

Гіпотеза: Якщо написати складний технічний пост з термінами, посиланнями і структурою - охоплення зникає, як бюджет на зимовий тім-білдінг. Методологія: Пишемо про Kubernetes, CI/CD, SOLID і складну бізнес-логіку. Публікуємо та бачимо тишу. Порівнюємо з постом, де просто написано: "Головне - просто вірити в себе і пити воду." І раптом - 20К переглядів та коментарі. Результати: Попсовий контент перемагає складні думки у 9 випадках з 10. П.С. Якщо хтось бачив технічний пост з вірусним успіхом - діліться лінкой будь ласочка. Питання до спільноти, які ваші гіпотези, колеги? - Не вміємо файно давати складне - 35%; - Алгоритми дискримінуют складне - 20%; - Адаптація мозку до простоти - 35%; Ви про що, взагалі то? - 10%  |          |
