My Biography

---

I, Nikulin Dmitry Nikolaevich, was [born](./MyData.md#birthday) in Donetsk.
At the age of 7, I started attending [School](./MyData.md#schoolno).
Interested in exact sciences, I often found myself among the participants of Olympiads in mathematics, physics, and geography.
I also actively participated in the social and extracurricular life of the school.
I was a member of various clubs: folk dance, music (piano), sports (football), as well as a political agitation brigade.

After completing the [9th](./MyData.md#completingninethgrade) grade, I moved to the Rostov region, where I lived for six months, studying at a [local school](./MyData.md#rostovschoolno).
At this school, I nearly became a participant of the Rostov region Olympiad in mathematics, having won the district-level competition.
Upon returning to [Donetsk](./MyData.md#returningtodonetsk) I [studied](./MyData.md#secondschoolno) in the city of Donetsk (like in the two previous schools, in a class with a mathematical focus).

Having received secondary education, I entered Donetsk Institute of Railway Transport, specializing in "Automation and Automation in Railway Transport" with a focus on "Signaling, Centralization, and Blocking."
From the second year, I became interested in IT technologies (trying to perform all control and calculation tasks using computers), especially programming.
During the 3rd and 4th years, I wrote programs in Delphi for knowledge control and file conversion.

I also conducted research in higher mathematics (Interval Calculus) and applied mechanics (Calculation of Characteristics of a Water Pump), but did not achieve final results.
Until the third year, I served as a class monitor, but due to circumstances, I ceased to hold this position.

From the fourth year, I worked initially as a loader, and then (combining it with my main job) as a computer specialist at a small private trading enterprise.

In 2001, I became the best student of the "Railway Transport Infrastructure" faculty.
After obtaining a diploma as an electrician in railway transport, I went to work in accordance with the distribution to the Information and Statistical Center of the Donetsk Railway in 2001.
