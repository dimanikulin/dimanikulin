# Introduction

At [DOU Day 2024](TODO to put a link) I found quite interesting the [ChatGPT Solutions Architect Assistent](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-J6uBbvDrm-solutions-architect-assistent)

It gave me undersnading on how I can use AI to [create architecture vision](https://github.com/dovchar/architecture-vision-GPTs?tab=readme-ov-file) from scratch spending hours but not days.  

So I decided to try it on my project to start.

# Preparation

## Anonymization

Here we need to write sabout business case anonymization, so **AI** that you use for assitance will not find out the details for commercial project if any.

What you need to do at least is to remove any **PII** (*Personally Identifiable Information*) from input documentation.

So I created *Sample case anonymizated.docx* from *Sample case.docx*.

## Preparation for input docs

As input documentation for creation architecture vision the following artifacts might be considered:

- RFP (Request for Proposal)
- RFI (Request for Information)
- Text of customer request

Becacause I did not have any from those documents for my *Sample Case* I used *ChatGPT* (not Assistant meontioned previpsly) to help me to create business case(*Sample case anonymizated RFP.docx*) from anonymizated input doc (*Sample case anonymizated.docx*).
It kept such chapters as

# Assitance

## Defining the architecture drivers

First it suggested to define **the architecture drivers**

**Me** Hi, I need to create an architectural vision

**AI** What type of help do you need to create the architecture vision? Please choose one of the following:

RFP (Request for Proposal)
RFI (Request for Information)
Text of customer request

**Me** 1

**AI**

Since you've chosen RFP (Request for Proposal), we can now proceed by defining the architecture drivers, which include the following steps:

Business Case and Business Goals
Constraints
Main Use Cases
Main Features
Domain Diagram
Quality Attribute Scenarios
Let's begin by defining the business case and business goals.

Could you provide details or key points from the RFP that define the business case and goals?

# Conclusion

For each work I performed I noticed the time I spent and here a full table to describe that.
