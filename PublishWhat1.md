# Publication structure

You shall remember content shall be structured!
And it is extrimly impornat for big text.

So there should be paragraphs with proper indentation, headings and subheadings, bulleted or numbered lists.

Despite it shall structerd I would not recomened to have more then 3 levels.

Please notice order of chapters is important. I use order from science document. 

## Must Have Chapters
Let speak about Chapters to have any way
I would call following chapters as must have:

- Headline 
- Overview
- Tags
- Table of contents

## Optional chapters
I would like to say **Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations** and **References** chapters are optional.

Generally there's no need for a glossary. 

If there are terms the reader may not know, please explain them where and when they are mentioned.

# What I put into my chapters
