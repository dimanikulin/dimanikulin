# Publication structure

You shall remember content shall be structured!
And it is extrimly impornat for big text.

So there should be paragraphs with proper indentation, headings and subheadings, bulleted or numbered lists.

Despite it shall structerd I would not recomened to have more then 3 levels.

## Must Have Chapters
let speak about Chapters to have any way
I would call following chapters as must have:

- Headline 
- Article descption
- Tags
- Table of contents
- Content

## Optional chapters
Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
There's no need for a glossary. If there are terms the reader may not know, please explain them where and when they are mentioned.

Please notice order of chapters is important
