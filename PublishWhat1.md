# Publication Structure

When creating content, it is crucial to prioritize structure, especially for larger texts.
The following guidelines should be adhered to:

- Paragraphs and Indentation: Ensure that paragraphs are used to maintain clear segmentation of ideas. Implement proper indentation to enhance readability.
- Headings and Subheadings: Utilize headings and subheadings to organize content hierarchically. Limit heading levels to three for simplicity and clarity.
- Lists: Integrate bulleted or numbered lists to present information concisely.
- Chapter Order: Recognize the significance of the order of chapters, following the conventions of scientific documents.

By adhering to these guidelines, your content will not only be well-structured but also enhance the overall readability and comprehension of the larger text.


## Must Have Chapters
Let speak about Chapters to have any way
I would call following chapters as must have:

- Headline 
- Overview
- Tags
- Table of contents

## Optional chapters
I would like to say **Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations** and **References** chapters are optional.

Generally there's no need for a glossary. 

If there are terms the reader may not know, please explain them where and when they are mentioned.
