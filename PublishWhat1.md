# Publication Structure

When creating content, it is crucial to prioritize structure, especially for larger texts.
The following guidelines should be adhered to:

- Paragraphs and Indentation: Ensure that paragraphs are used to maintain clear segmentation of ideas. Implement proper indentation to enhance readability.
- Headings and Subheadings: Utilize headings and subheadings to organize content hierarchically. Limit heading levels to three for simplicity and clarity.
- Lists: Integrate bulleted or numbered lists to present information concisely.
- Chapter Order: Recognize the significance of the order of chapters, following the conventions of scientific documents.

By adhering to these guidelines, your content will not only be well-structured but also enhance the overall readability and comprehension of the larger text.

# Must-Have Chapters
In any comprehensive document, the following chapters are essential:

- Headline: This chapter serves as the introduction, providing a concise and compelling overview of the document's main theme or purpose.
- Overview: The overview chapter expands on the headline, offering a more detailed insight into the document's content, objectives, and key points.
- Tags: In this chapter, relevant tags are included to categorize and label the document, aiding in searchability and organization.
- Table of Contents: The table of contents chapter provides a structured outline of the document, listing its sections and subsections, guiding readers through the content.

Ensuring the inclusion of these must-have chapters will contribute to the clarity, accessibility, and overall effectiveness of the document.

## Optional chapters
I would like to say **Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations** and **References** chapters are optional.

Generally there's no need for a glossary. 

If there are terms the reader may not know, please explain them where and when they are mentioned.
