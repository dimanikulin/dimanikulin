# Publication Structure

When creating content, it is crucial to prioritize structure, especially for larger texts.
The following guidelines should be adhered to:

- Paragraphs and Indentation: Ensure that paragraphs are used to maintain clear segmentation of ideas. Implement proper indentation to enhance readability.
- Headings and Subheadings: Utilize headings and subheadings to organize content hierarchically. Limit heading levels to three for simplicity and clarity.
- Lists: Integrate bulleted or numbered lists to present information concisely.
- Chapter Order: Recognize the significance of the order of chapters, following the conventions of scientific documents.

By adhering to these guidelines, your content will not only be well-structured but also enhance the overall readability and comprehension of the larger text.

# Must-Have Chapters
In any comprehensive document, the following chapters are essential:

- Headline: This chapter serves as the introduction, providing a concise and compelling overview of the document's main theme or purpose.
- Overview: The overview chapter expands on the headline, offering a more detailed insight into the document's content, objectives, and key points.
- Tags: In this chapter, relevant tags are included to categorize and label the document, aiding in searchability and organization.
- Table of Contents: The table of contents chapter provides a structured outline of the document, listing its sections and subsections, guiding readers through the content.

Ensuring the inclusion of these must-have chapters will contribute to the clarity, accessibility, and overall effectiveness of the document.

# Optional Chapters
I would like to note that the **Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations** and **References** chapters are optional.

Generally, there is no need for a glossary.

If there are terms that the reader may not know, please explain them where and when they are mentioned.

# What I put into "Headline" chapter

TBD to describe what is headline 

I use **ChatGPT** to assist me in generating headlines.
Therefore, I copy the entire content into **ChatGPT** and ask it to generate a headline.
Please note that sometimes it may require a few corrections because it might extract a headline based only on a part of the content and not the entire text.

# What I put into "Overview" Chapter
The **overview** chapter typically offers a brief summary or introduction to the main topics covered in the document.
It serves as a way to orient the reader and provide context before delving into more detailed information.

Alternatively, this chapter is often referred to as **TL;DR** - *too long; didn't read*.

Similar to the previous chapter, I use **ChatGPT** to assist me in generating the **Overview**. 
Therefore, I copy the entire content into **ChatGPT** and ask it to generate an **Overview**.
