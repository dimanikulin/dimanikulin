What do I usually do to switch context and relax before engaging in the next brain activity?
I play chess!
You might wonder, but moving the chess pieces from one cell to another helps me relax.

And I have noticed a direct correlation between the amount of glucose I consume and the number of chess games I win. It seems that the more sugar I consume, the more successful I am in chess.

Now, I'm curious to know what you do to employ a similar approach?
