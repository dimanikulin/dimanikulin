# 1. Company

*Company Name*: HealthTech Solutions Inc.

*Industry*: Healthcare Technology

*Mission Statement*: Our mission is to revolutionize patient care by providing cutting-edge digital health solutions that enable personalized, data-driven healthcare. Through our advanced Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, we connect patients, doctors, and healthcare providers to optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient well-being.

*Overview:* HealthTech Solutions is a leader in developing IoT-enabled healthcare solutions aimed at providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and early intervention for chronic disease management. With a strong portfolio of AI-driven health products, we aim to transform traditional healthcare systems into data-driven, proactive models.

# 2. Project

*Project Name*: MedConnect IoT Platform

*Project Objective*: The MedConnect IoT platform aims to collect, monitor, and analyze data from patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. By leveraging smart medical devices and wearable technology, the platform will enable continuous patient monitoring, reduce hospital admissions, and support remote diagnosis and treatment plans.

*Problem Statement*:
Currently there are two platforms under data platform umbrella - one on Azure (Patient and Usage Data) and another on AWS (Sleep Data). AWS receive the data from IoT sensors, performs aggregation of that data and exposes it for the client apps. Patient and Usage Data is hosted on Azure cloud, it is derived from Patient Data and its main focus is product & company-wide analytics, ML models learning and future product development cases. Having two Clouds is too costly for us. It also reduce data managibility, security and collaboration.

*Solution*:
We would like to leverage numerous advantages from data consolidation in a single cloud, including improved data management, enhanced analytics capabilities, cost efficiencies, better data security, and streamlined collaboration within an organization.

# 9. Current technical state

Now size of AWS is ~20TB, Azure is ~5TB. Data includes among other - patient data, sensor data, click stream, and data like order data, supply chain data from the IT data platform.

We have Java, .Net, NodeJS and Python in our technology portfolio.

# 10. Future technical state

Today we have < 10 external partners but going to grow 5x times in next 3 years.

We're looking forward to introduce SLAs.

At the end of the day we would like to make our AI/ML teams to work in isolated environments to not interfer with each other. Data access policies should be supported in such case (e.g. we should be able to configure what kind of information should be available and what is not).
The future plan is to reuse environments feature to expose the data for external partners.
