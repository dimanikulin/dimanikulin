# Introduction

This is what we started from:

- **Me** - Hi, Can you help me in solution architect advisory?
- **AI** - What type of help do you need?
- **Me** - To advise a customer on how to create unified data platform.
- **AI** - Great! For advising on a unified data platform, we need to create an architecture vision document. Could you provide additional information like: Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Information (RFI), Text of the customer request. Let me know which one you have.
- **Me** - RFP
- **AI** - Please share the Request for Proposal (RFP) document or key details from it so I can assist you in defining the architecture vision for the unified data platform.
- **Me** - Sent [business case](./AIForSWArchitects_BusinessCase_en.md).
- **AI** - Thank you for sharing the details. Based on the RFP, we will proceed with defining the architecture vision for the MedConnect IoT Platform's Unified Data Platform. The first step is to define Architecture Drivers, which include business goals, constraints, and use cases. Let's begin with defining the main business goals.

At each step it suggested to clarify current step response or go to next step.

# Essential business goals for the solution

| # | Description          | Priority  |
| - | ---------------------|:------------:|
| - | Create a unified data platform to support real-time and batch data ingestion. | Hard |
| - | Enable scalable data storage optimized for healthcare data (vital signs, historical records). | Hard |
| - | Provide seamless data access for healthcare providers, patients, and analytics teams. | Soft |
| - | Ensure compliance with healthcare standards (e.g., HIPAA) for data security and privacy. | Hard |
| - | Support predictive analytics to enable proactive healthcare decision-making. | Soft |
| - | Optimize data storage and minimize the need for cross-environment data copying. |Soft |

- **AI** - Would you like to proceed with defining constraints, or should we continue working on business goals?
- **Me** - What are key risks?
- **AI** - The key risks associated with the MedConnect IoT Platform's Unified Data Platform project can stem from various technical, operational, and business challenges. Below are potential risks based on the RFP

# Key design risks for the solution

| # | Risk Description     | Mitigation Strategy  |
| - | ---------------------|:------------:|
|   | *Data Security & Privacy Compliance*: Ensuring the platform adheres to HIPAA and other healthcare data standards. | Implement end-to-end encryption, audit trails, and regular compliance checks. Engage security experts.|
|   | *Integration with Multiple Devices*: Difficulty in ensuring compatibility with diverse IoT devices and healthcare systems.| Establish strong partnerships with device manufacturers. Use open standards for device interoperability.|
|   | *Scalability for Real-Time Data Processing*: The system might struggle to handle large volumes of data in real-time from numerous devices.| Design a scalable, distributed architecture using cloud-native solutions (e.g., auto-scaling, load balancing).|
|   | *Data Quality & Accuracy*: Risk of low-quality or incorrect data affecting predictive analytics and healthcare decisions. | Implement rigorous data validation, monitoring tools, and introduce feedback loops to correct inaccuracies.|
|   | *High Initial Costs*: Setting up a cloud-based platform with real-time and batch data ingestion capabilities may have high upfront costs. | Develop a phased implementation plan and optimize cloud resource usage to lower costs.|
|   | *Third-Party Dependency: Reliance on third-party devices and cloud services, leading to potential service disruptions. | Include backup service providers and design failover strategies for critical services.|
|   | *Cross-Environment Data Consistency: Potential issues with data consistency across multiple environments. | Design robust data synchronization mechanisms and minimize data copying through efficient storage solutions.|

- **AI** - Would you like to continue with defining constraints, or should we explore further details on these risks?
- **Me** - Constraints
- **AI** - The section enumerates the main business and technical constraints for the solution.

# Constraints

| # | Risk Description     | Priority     |
| - | ---------------------|:------------:|
| 1 | The platform must comply with HIPAA and other healthcare regulations regarding data security and privacy. | Hard |
| 2 | The data platform should integrate with multiple IoT devices and smart medical devices for data ingestion. | Hard |
| 3 | The solution must ensure 99.9% uptime for healthcare providers accessing patient data. | Hard |
| 4 | Data storage should support polyglot persistence to store different data formats for diverse use cases. | Soft |
| 5 | The platform should support real-time and batch processing with minimal latency for critical healthcare data.| Hard |
| 6 | Ensure cross-environment data consistency without redundant data copying across cloud platforms. | Soft |
| 7 | The system must minimize storage costs by using efficient data formats and compression techniques. |Soft |
| 8 | Third-party cloud services (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) should be integrated as the primary infrastructure. | Hard |

- **AI** - Would you like to proceed with defining the main use cases, or should we continue working on these constraints?
- **Me** - Main use cases

# Main use cases

- **AI** -  Let's define the main use cases for the unified data platform. Do you prefer the output in Markdown format or PlantUML? - **Me** - Markdown

| # | Use Case Name     | Description | Actor     |
| - | ------------------|-------------|:------------:|
| 1 |Patient Data Ingestion | Capture real-time health data (e.g., glucose levels, blood pressure) from wearable and home devices.| Patients, Medical Devices |
| 2 | Real-Time Data Monitoring | Healthcare providers monitor patient vitals in real-time, receiving alerts for critical changes.| Healthcare Providers |
| 3 | Predictive Analytics & Alerts | Use AI algorithms to predict potential health risks and trigger alerts to doctors for interventions.| Healthcare Providers |
| 4 | Data Access & Analytics Dashboard | Enable healthcare providers to access patient history, trends, and analytics through a dashboard.| Healthcare Providers |
| 5 | Patient Data Access | Patients can view their own health data, trends, and receive personalized insights via a mobile app.| Patients |
| 6 | Data Export to Third-Party Systems | Export patient data to external healthcare systems or insurance companies for further analysis. | Insurance Companies |
| 7 | Data Storage & Archiving | Store and archive patient health data, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.| Data Platform |
| 8 | Data Sharing Across Environments | Synchronize and share data across cloud environments without duplicating or losing information.| Data Platform, Cloud Providers |
