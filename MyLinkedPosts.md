| | Working with GPT | ChatGPT in CV | cv skills | | [18/07/2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dimanikulin_chatgpt-cv-skills-activity-7086958836036644864-hpB6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) {TBD/TBD/TBD/TBD} | Nowadays, many people include their experience with ChatGPT in their CVs as a way to showcase their skills and expertise in various domains. However, in my opinion, this practice may seem excessive. Why? Because it's akin to listing the ability to move one's body as a skill. Is it OK to mention ChatGPT in CV? - Yes **0%** - No **100%** - ChatGPT knows answer **0%**|  |

The only thing it did not help me with was finding my social s  tyle. What about you? Do you consider ChatGPT a useful tool? - Yes **80%**, - No **12%**, - Never tried it **8%** | |

Because I have "only" 6 on my laptop - Facebook messenger, Microsoft Skype and Teams, Google Chat, Twitter, Slack and Telegram. And "only" 8 on my smartphone. And there are additionally two email clients by the way. How many messengers there are on your devices? Which ones I missed? | |

They keep our connections safe and provide access to restricted networks. As a result, it has become normal to have more than one VPN client installed on your device. For example, I currently have three clients installed on my laptop. What is the maximum number of VPN clients you have or have had on your device? - 2; - 3; - more than 3; - What is a VPN? | |
