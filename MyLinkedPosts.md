Спершу історія. У мене була ранка незагойна неглибока, яка почалася з маленької подряпини. На жаль, вона поступово розширювалася, мабуть тому, що потрапила ззовні якась активна речовина. При чому інші ранки гоїлися, а ця ні. Довелося звернутися до страхової за медичною страховкою. Я припускав, що страхові повинні рекомендувати прості рішення, щоб заощадити гроші страховий і мені час. І коли дзвонив у страхову, думав, що зараз направлять до дерматолога. Та ні. Іди до терапевта або до хірурга, на вибір - сказала страхова. Справа в тому, що у медиків і у страховиків є протоколи - алгоритми постановки діагнозу та методи лікування. Терапевт поставила досить серйозний діагноз – виразка. Ну що б переконається, рекомендувала піти до хірурга. Ну що б не закопали швидше, ніж потрібно) Хірург сказав, що не все так погано – локальне зараження шкіри. Але щоб переконатися в діагнозі, потрібно йти, еврика, до дерматолога. Дерматолог підтверджує діагноз та дає простенький, але ефективний крем. Крем за два-три дні все лікує і через 2 тижні мені вже потрібно постаратися, щоб знайти де була ранка. Принагідно дерматолог рекомендує ще здати 100 500 аналізів і піти до ендокринолога. Підсумок для страхової: Мені оплачені 4 лікарі та купа аналізів. Міг бути один лікар і менше аналізів. Підсумок для мене: Зрозумів, що протокольність – не тільки добре, але ще й погано) Ну тобто, нежить лікаря плюс мінус можуть лікувати без зайвих відвідувань медичних установ, але якщо трохи складніше - готуйся до квестів: - А давай спробуємо ось це, і ще ось це, і трохи ось це. - Ну якщо не працює, то тоді це, це і це. - Нічого не спрацювало? Ну тоді йди до іншого лікаря. Я розумію, що при всій технічності та розвиненості медицини, досі існує багато хвороб, які і лікувати важко і діагностувати причину теж. Наприклад, у 2020 році я здавав аналіз, формулу якого знайшли лише у 2017. Тобто аналізу було лише 3 роки. З одного боку ми там робимо заміну серця та нирок, лазимо по судинах, підключаємося до мозку та нервів. І на тобі шукали так довго хімічну формулу. Можливо, в деяких інших країнах інакше. А Ви маєте аналогічний досвід? | |

| | Interviews | Interview Red Flags | interviewer cplusplus cpp technicalinterview | <img src="./Images/InterviewRedFlags.png" alt="Interview Red Flags" /> | [15/05/2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dimanikulin_redflags-interview-activity-7063775173203640321-fEDW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) {TBD/TBD/TBD/TBD} | Let me start with a small history about a technical interview I recently hosted. The interviewee greeted me in Ukrainian, which was a pleasant surprise. When I asked how he learned Ukrainian, he explained that he has friends in Ukraine and has visited them. I suggested we switch to Ukrainian, but he declined as he doesn't speak it very well. During the interview, I noticed that he had two or even three monitors, one of which he used to communicate with me through a camera. At first, he struggled with practical tasks, but when I checked his theoretical knowledge, he showed a good level. I asked him a lot of questions, and he answered them in the same manner - he would think and then move his eyes to the keyboard or other monitor before providing an answer. After a while, he would either say that he wasn't sure about the answer or give me the wrong answer entirely. But then he would provide the correct answer. Because time was limited, I had to rush him in his thinking for each answer, which made him nervous. I noticed that when he moved his eyes, he seemed to be reading something on his second display. It was clear that he was trying to cheat. So, some red flags to watch out for during an interview include: - Avoiding eye contact; - Acting nervous or defensive; - Appearing to read notes; - Being overly friendly in an attempt to disarm you and lower your vigilance.PS. Based on real interview.| |
| | Interviews | AI tools for interview | interviewer ai interviewtips cheating | <img src="./Images/InterviewAITools.png" alt="Interview AI Tools" /> | [01/08/2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dimanikulin_ai-interviewtips-cheating-activity-7092037033061232640-bL5J?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) {TBD/TBD/TBD/TBD} | Nowadays, people actively use AI to learn, grow, and engage in many other positive endeavors. However, some individuals may employ AI to cheat, gaining an advantage during interviews. One such new AI tool is called Ecout, which can listen to an interviewer's questions in real-time and generate instant answers. This poses a potential problem for interviewers. To detect such cases, I suggest the following: - Maintain eye contact. If a person frequently avoids eye contact, it may indicate the use of cheating tools.; - Avoid waiting too long for an answer, as this could allow candidates to receive hints from AI tools incrementally.; And here are some other tips for interviewers: - Be maximally objective to ensure fairness throughout the interview process. - Maintain a poker face, as revealing emotions might help a candidate guess the correct answer. What measures do you take to avoid the use of AI tools during interviews? Please share your thoughts in the comments. | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zainkahn_rip-job-interviews-this-new-ai-tool-called-ugcPost-7069295920248406016-zBao?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) |

This time they did not propose a big prize for me just for providing my credit card information. Instead, they used actor name (Peter Pine) to contact them � for me it�s the best fishing attack for now. | |

I can receive a payment with amount 10 Million US Dollars. What I need is just to send my address, bank name and address, account name and number, Swift Code etc. However, I need to reject this nice offer because I do not know what to do with such big money. )))  | |

They sent me an email with a job description. Also they even provided me a password and nice attachment to open so I could start working immediately. Not this time, sorry guys ;-) | |

This time they did not propose big money neither high-paying job with WFH. They just wanted to warn me about disk space. | |
| | Fishing | Sensitive or confidential language | fishing staysafe emailsecurity internetsecurity | <img src="./Images/fishing06.jpg" alt="fishing 06" /> | [06/06/2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dimanikulin_staysafe-fishing-activity-7071738520201027584-TmuQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) {TBD/TBD/TBD/TBD} | It is unfortunately true that some people may use sensitive or confidential language (Confidential! Sensitive Information!) in their messages as a tactic to deceive or manipulate others, and they may not be concerned about the consequences of doing so. If you receive a message that you suspect may be fraudulent or deceptive, it is important to exercise caution and to verify the authenticity of the message before taking any action. This may involve double-checking the source of the message, looking for signs of phishing or other scams, or seeking guidance from a trusted authority or expert. By taking these precautions, you can help protect yourself from potential harm and avoid falling victim to scams or other types of fraud. Stay safe! | |
