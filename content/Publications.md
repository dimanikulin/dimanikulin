So far I have following publications:

### Exploring the World of Multimedia Information Retrieval Systems: A Comprehensive Guide
The article provides an introduction to Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, which are designed to search and retrieve information from multimedia sources like images, audio, and video. 

It explains the different components of MIR systems, such as feature extraction, indexing, and retrieval, and discusses some of the challenges associated with MIR, including the subjective nature of multimedia data and the need for efficient algorithms to handle large datasets. 

Overall, the article offers a helpful overview for those interested in learning about MIR systems.
