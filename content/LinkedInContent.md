# Just Joined LinkedIn (In English)

What do you think about LinkedIn content?
About a year ago, I posted a picture about content and received a lot of responses.

What irritates you the most?

- Dating
- Asking for agreement or disagreement
- Memes from the 20th century
- Pet photos

Please share your opinion in the comments.
