## How russians play chess?
Yes, it is not really easy to resign.
Even when you just play chess and when you have already lost.
When I am loosing chess game I am saying "thank you, well played" and I am getting upset.
It differs from what usually rUSSIANS do.
They say all rude words they even know when they loose just chess game.
Another example what rUSSIANS do when they loose the "GAME" on real battle field - they bomb usual people, infrastructure like usual TERRORISTS.
