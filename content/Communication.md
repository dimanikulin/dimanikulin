## We need more Messengers!

Guys from big IT Companies, we need "much more" messengers on our devices!

Because I have "only" 6 on my laptop - Facebook messenger, Microsoft Skype and Teams, Google Chat, Twitter, Slack and Telegram.

And "only" 8 on my smartphone.

And there are additionally two email clients by the way.

How many messengers there are on your devices?

Which ones I missed?
