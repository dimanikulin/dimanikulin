## Which title describes better a real job?
I have seen a lot of different titles in CV, social networks like "Consultant", "Consulting" etc. 
From my side it is difficult to understand what "IT Consultant" really does and knows.

Which title describes better a real job?

IT Consultant **10%**
C++ Developer **90%**
