## Multimedia Organizers functions
A program that helps organizing photos is known as a **photo organizer**.
There are a variety of **photo organizer** software programs available on the market, and each one provides various features and tools to assist in organizing photos.
Thus, let’s consider main functions multimedia organizers perform:

* they provide the possibility to search through a photo set by organizing photos based on their date, location, categories, etc.;
* they offer an option of creating a folder structure and place the files in it;
* they automate the import of new photos into **IR Multimedia Systems**.

Additionally, they make photo albums more searchable (that is driven by **IR Multimedia Systems**) by enriching the **metadata** (and improving its consistency) with minimal human involvement.

Therefore, they are chosen as a subject for the overview and comparison.
A list of **Photo Organizers** for professional photographers is created, and those [organizers](https://www.pixpa.com/blog/photo-organiser) can also be used by an ordinary user with a big photo album.
Pertinent online [courses](https://www.organizepictures.com/organize-digital-photos-course) are available to instruct users on how to arrange the photos.
More detailed comparison of photo organizers is provided by Wikipedia and is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_organizer).
