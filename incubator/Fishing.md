Confidential, Sensitive Information!
It is unfortunately true that some people may use sensitive or confidential language in their messages as a tactic to deceive or manipulate others, and they may not be concerned about the consequences of doing so. 
If you receive a message that you suspect may be fraudulent or deceptive, it is important to exercise caution and to verify the authenticity of the message before taking any action. 
This may involve double-checking the source of the message, looking for signs of phishing or other scams, or seeking guidance from a trusted authority or expert. 
By taking these precautions, you can help protect yourself from potential harm and avoid falling victim to scams or other types of fraud.
