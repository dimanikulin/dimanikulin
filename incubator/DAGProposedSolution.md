## Context view for standalone application

A context diagram (view) defines solution bounds and connection with third parties like external systems, users and data. 

As shown above on the context diagram there is an interaction between Users and Proposed Solution. 
Interactions shall be implemented using UI web interface. 

To get the input the solution interacts with Online and Offline UML tools using its API to get initial Software Architecture and to save extracted Software Architecture.

To get access to code, configuration and DB the interactions with the Version Control Systems and interaction with DB are used.

Finally, Report Storage is used to save the outputs extracted from Architecture under analysis.
