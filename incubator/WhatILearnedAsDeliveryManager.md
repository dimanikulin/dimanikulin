and How to get more engagement with your open source project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, I didn't learn much as a Delivery Manager. Still, here are some points to consider...

## Project Status tracking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracking project status is quite an important activity of Delivery Manager.

### GitHub projects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **GitHub Projects** is tool for tracking project status online integrated into your GitHub profile.
It is quite easy to use, and it doesn't have a lot of functions. 
Here it [is](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/projects/3)

### ProjectLibre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of all the above-mentioned, a more compex solution was required. 
My choice was [ProjectLibre](https://www.projectlibre.com/product/1-alternative-microsoft-project-open-source).
ProjectLibre desktop is a free and open-source project management software system, intended ultimately as a standalone replacement for Microsoft Project.
Despite being a free and small app, it gave me everything I needed.
