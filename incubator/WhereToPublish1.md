# Content
Here I will describe the expereince working with sites/platforms where I publish content
The main question here is *Why do you publish content?* 
It will help you to choose the right platform to publish. 

For first I selected several *yeasy to go* platforms
- hackernoon
- hashnode
- dev.to
- medium
- reddit
- quora
- linkedin 

There will be a question - how to manage with several platforms especialy if have a lot of materials to publish.
That is not big deal really. I created separate table with columns **platforms** adn lines like **publications**.

## hackernoon
*[HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/) publishes technology stories and builds publishing software.*
 
It has content editor like a WordPad.

For each story it provides a possibility to create 
- **Feature picture** - Title picture
- **Tags** - the set of keywords to speed up the search
- **Make Your Story Stand Out** -  up to 160 symbols description
- **Emoji** - Credibility Indicator Guide 
- **Give Shout Out to People on Twitter** - Send a link to Twitter
- **Townhall Mode:** - Anyone Can Comment : *On* or *Off*
- **TL;DR** - Post Description
- **First Seen At** a link to original story, only for republished stories

It provides full review cicle with even human review - up to one week.
I tried to publish 3 times without success, reason for rejection: too small, not actual, not worked links and spelling errors.

For other story it said *Promoting links in stories, @username? You would need to enter our brand as author program instead*.
It meant too much links to one domain inside of a story

Please notice it might generate wrong **TL;DR**. In my case it generated **TL;DR** basing on part of text but not whole publication.

Also it is imposible to discuss the problem that editor found right on the platform. I recieved emails and could you reply back.

## hashnode
[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) is a one-stop platform to start blogging as a developer. Start a blog. Share knowledge, attain creator independence, and grow your career.

It has content editor like a WordPad.

What I really liked in **hashnode** it has nice feature - checking for syntax in **Grammarly**

For each story it provides a possibility to create 
- **Cover** - Main picture
- **Subtitle** - Description

While editing it shows article stats: 
**Word count**: 869 words
**Paragraphs**: 27 paragraphs
**Read time**: 4 minutes

For each story it provides a possibility to 

- select **A BLOG** and **ARTICLE SLUG**
