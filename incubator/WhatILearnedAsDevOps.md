To ignore some temporary files, build results, and files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons I used [.gitignore](.gitignore) from [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
I extended it with dirs with images as I did not want to commit them because of big size, autogenerated by doxygen files and not ready for commit content
IN the root folder there are also all md file kept 

There is aloso main README.md that keeps structured information for product and its implementation details.

TBD to speak main readm file sttucute, git hubm bages

### Automated code checks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Currently there are following automated checks to verify if the code meets code quality requirements:
* [Code QL](.github/workflows/codeqlanalysis.yml) Please see [[38]](./REFERENCES.md) TBD what for
* [code Checks](.github/workflows/codeChecks.yml) TBD what for
* [code factor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/dimanikulin/fva/issues) TBD what for
* [ms vc analysis](.github/workflows/msvc-analysis.yml) TBD what for
TODO - to add a bage for each code check


Please notice the installation packages for Windows is built using Wix;
Once a release happened the current [documentation generated from the code](https://dimanikulin.github.io/fva/) appeared.

### Building the code 
I use CMake to build the project on different platform CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.0)

if (WIN32)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES "-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ ${CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES}")
    set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -Wl,-Bstatic,--whole-archive -lwinpthread -Wl,--no-whole-archive")
endif (WIN32)

project(fva)

add_subdirectory(FVACommonLib)
add_subdirectory(FVAConfigurator)
add_subdirectory(FVADataProcessor)
add_subdirectory(FVADescriptionEditor)
add_subdirectory(FVADictionaryEditor)
add_subdirectory(FVAFlowController)
add_subdirectory(FVAOrganizer)
add_subdirectory(FVAOrganizerWizard)
add_subdirectory(FVAPlayer)
add_subdirectory(FVAViewer)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 environments to build – CI (git hub) and local developer one. 
[CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/Home) is used as a tool to control build process. 
It is selected as cross-platform [tool](https://cmake.org/) available on all target platforms to build the package. 
[This link](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-get-started.html) was used to make a build of QT code with a help of [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/Home).

#### Building the code using GitHub
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tool installation, configuration and processing are automated and based on GitHub actions with [main.yml](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)
All the steps are expected to be yml based only.
I used [[37]](FVADocMD/REFERENCES.md) to help me to set up the main GitHub action flow and [this link](https://github.com/jurplel/install-qt-action) to set up QT.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once code change is pushed to GitHub, [main workflow](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) is being executed and you will have new [Installation packages](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/releases) to use.
All steps to build a package are called on any push to master or TBD branch.
More details are located in comments and step names [here](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml).
TODO explain how to install and cfg on github site

#### Building the code locally
Still you can use [MS studio solution](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/blob/master/FVASW.sln) to build locally on Windows or [CMake](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) to build locally on any Windows, Mac or Linux. 


### Building the docs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To re-generate the docs you need to re-execute [documentation workflow](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/blob/master/.github/workflows/releaseDocs.yml) from workflow. As result you will have [this](./DoxyGeneratedDoc.pdf)

doxy.cfg

## Releasing code and docs
<img src="Images/BuildingCode.png" alt="BuildingCode"/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more important point was a definition of [building and releasing the product and documentation](./BUILD_RELEASE.md) 
Here you can find a description for: 
- [Building the code](./BUILD_RELEASE.md#buildingthecode) 
- [Building the code using GitHub](./BUILD_RELEASE.md#buildingthecodeusinggithub)
- [Building the code locally](./BUILD_RELEASE.md#buildingthecodelocally)
- [Building the docs](./BUILD_RELEASE.md#buildingthedocs)

Thus, I learned:
- how to build and release documentation using GitHub;
- how to release product using GitHub.

## Branch strategy
One more important point was a definition of [branch strategy](./BUILD_RELEASE.md#branchstrategy) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GitHub actions is used to implement the releasing of the product. 
It is configured to call release flow to start the creation of release product artifacts on creation or update the release branch.
TBD - describe naming and flow for branches.
TBD - create picture.
