www.copyscape.com

Please note we require 0% plagiarism/duplicate content and all sources must be cited properly.

When using a quote or definition from another source, it must be cited using an in-line link so we are giving attribution and the reader can verify the information.

However, we would prefer that these papers share a uniquely GL perspective and that the content is 100% original.

not recomened more then 3 levels

### Pictures 
No pictures - less views. pictires shall be related to content

picture orientation suggested to be album and not a book orienttaopn

you would have at least featured image as a title image. it shhould be active like a gif


### Tables 
if you provide tables please make sure that less filled columns are the end of table and wiseversa

### Size

For a customer-facing piece, I think this needs to be pared down as much as possible – ideally under 2500 words. 
It's a very dense read, and it's a big ask to expect an executive looking at their solution options to read a 40-page paper.
