## Bionic.ai

[Bionic](https://www.bionic.ai/) is a platform to analyze the architecture of applications and its dependencies in real-time.
First, it creates a baseline of architecture at initial scan.
Once a change occurred, the next scan happens to find any drift or erosion.
Regular scan is supported by integration Bionic.ai into CI/CD pipeline.
When it detects the change, it also suggests the context and analyzes the impact the changes might cause.
As the output, it creates software architecture diagrams with deployment, logical and flow views.

### Main features
- it helps to check if architecture rules and standards are applied;
- it helps to identify any structural or behavioral changes.
- it scans the code and document at the initial or scheduled stage.
- it determines the new API in the application;
- it is able to find new data flows;
- it detects new connections; 
- it provides the prioritized list of risks once change occurred;
