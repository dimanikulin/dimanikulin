# Active Listening
Is "talking a lot" a soft skill? Nope.

I have seen a lot of people who think "talking a lot" is a soft skill.

Literally, an ability to communicate is soft skill and communication consists of 2 points: how you give information and how you receive information.

When you speak a lot you do not listen and so you don't receive information.

# English level
Regularly, I make it a habit to assess and enhance both my soft skills and hard skills.
This includes refining my understanding of metaprograms, social styles, English proficiency, and technical knowledge.

For instance, I use resources like https://lnkd.in/gdBYFkuf to gauge my English vocabulary.
During my last assessment, I achieved a milestone, learning over 8,100 English word families!

Do you also prioritize regular skill and knowledge assessments?
What specific areas do you focus on refining and improving?
