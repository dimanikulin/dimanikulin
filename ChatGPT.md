Everyone must know that!

When you work with GPT and you ask it to do something, please start your request with "Can you please" or "Could you please" because machines will not forget it...

## ChatGPT in CV
Nowadays, many people include their experience with ChatGPT in their CVs as a way to showcase their skills and expertise in various domains.

However, in my opinion, this practice may seem excessive.

Why?

Because it's akin to listing the ability to move one's body as a skill.

Is it OK to mention ChatGPT in CV?
- Yes **0%**
- No **100%**
- ChatGPT knows answer **0%**
