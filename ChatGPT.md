# Do you consider ChatGPT a useful tool?

I have been using ChatGPT for 6 months and would like to share my experience working with it.

So far, it has helped me with:

- Proofreading
- Creating tags, headlines, and chapter descriptions from text
- Converting my text from upper case to lower case
- Generating poems
- Finding the top 10 sites to publish IT content
- Providing interesting facts about various topics
- Suggesting suitable images for provided text

The only thing it did not help me with was finding my social style.

What about you? Do you consider ChatGPT a useful tool?

- Yes **80%**
- No **12%**
- Never tried it **8%**
