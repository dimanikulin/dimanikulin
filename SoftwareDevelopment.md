## Which title describes better a real job?
I have seen a lot of different titles in CV, social networks like "Consultant", "Consulting" etc. 
From my side it is difficult to understand what "IT Consultant" really does and knows.

Which title describes better a real job?

- IT Consultant **10%**
- C++ Developer **90%**

## What do you usually do to provide accurate estimations?
I have had significant experience in software development, yet I still struggle with estimation.

What I usually do is multiply my estimations by 2-3, but even that approach doesn't always work.

I have rarely come across a developer who is consistently good at estimating.

So what do you usually do to provide accurate estimations?
- Break tasks into smaller parts **56%**
- Use historical data **10%**
- Involve the team **16%**
- Regularly review and learn **18%**

Please share your opinions in the comments.

## C++ death

Do you have any programming language/technology that were predicted to die a long time ago but are still going strong?

For me, it's C++. I started using it more than 20 years ago, and after a while (2-3 years), there were predictions that C++ would die soon due to the emergence of new languages and technologies.

But that didn't happen, and those fast-approaching languages and technologies are still around.

So, when was the first time you heard that your language/technology X would die?

- 20 years ago
- 10 years ago
- 5 years ago
- never heard

Please share in the comments your programming language/technology that was predicted to die but didn't.
